<h1 align="center">Satellite: A GraphQL Backend-as-a-Service</h1>

Satellite is an open-source GraphQL Backend-as-a-Service that makes it easy to get a GraphQL API up and running to power the frontend of your dynamic web application. It abstracts away all of the complexity of creating a GraphQL backend so that you can deploy your application faster. Once deployed, Satellite leverages Kubernetes as a container orchestrator to allow you to host as many GraphQL backends as you need, configurable through a straight-forward admin GUI.
